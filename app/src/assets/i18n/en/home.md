# What is this?

**Supermini Games** has three main goals:

1. Host fun, fast, addictive games for web
2. Educate the next generation in software development
3. Enable anyone with moderate programming experience to build a entire game in less than one hour

# Story

I have always wanted to build something like this, as I fondly remembered the "simple" days as a kid building
QuickBasic games in DOS. It was so simple, so pure, and in a few hours you could throw together a full game.

Sadly, the web is complicated, build configurations take forever, and browser compatibility especially with
mobile can be a nightmare. I built Supermini Games on vacation while in Italy. My goal was to make it available
to everyone so that if you have a game idea you can build it, publish it, and watch others play it within an hour.
