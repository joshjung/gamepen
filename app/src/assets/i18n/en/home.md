# Supermini Games

Supermini Games exists for two primary purposes:

1. Educate the next generation in software development
2. Enable anyone with moderate programming experience to build a entire game in less than one hour

# Story

I have always wanted to build something like this, as I fondly remembered the "simple" days as a kid building
QuickBasic games in DOS. It was so simple, so pure, and in a few hours you could throw together a full game.

Sadly, the web is complicated, build configurations take forever, and browser compatibility especially with
mobile can be a nightmare. I built Supermini Games on vacation while in Italy. My goal was to make it available
to everyone.
